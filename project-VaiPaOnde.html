                                    <p>On both niches, companies saw great marketing opportunities: some provided free courses, some provided a few extra free months of their service, and some just created content marketing articles on "how to prepare your home office environment", "how to keep your exercise routine from home", and similar subjects.

                                    <p>Vai Pa Onde is a personal project, conceived and developed during (and because of) the Quarantine. As such, it gave me the opportunity to experiment a lot, both with the product's functionalities and overall visual aspect. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Given the context described in the Introduction, the idea of which problem to address came from something that happened to me: I'm an online course freak, and I was absolutely stunned by the courses that became free during the quarantine. However, I was coming across many of them on social media, email, or even WhatsApp messages, and when I had the actual free time to take some classes I couldn't remember where to find them - and would spend most of that spare time trying to find it them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Thus I chose to address <b>the amount of free content made available, and how hard it was to find it. </b>

                                    <p>I went back to my email inbox and checked out everything I received from companies - newsletters, heart-warming messages, extended trials and etc.</p>
                                    <p>Social media was a great source as well: companies sharing everything they were giving out for free, Instagrams profiles started to create specific content for quarantine times (such as chefs teaching easy recipes or personal trainers suggesting exercises to do at home).</p>
                                    <p>Finally I went to google to see what else I could find. There was a lot out there. I even found a collaborative google sheet for free content (so the problem was real).</p>

                                        Once I saw some people were having similar issues with the amount of information, it was time to decide what kind of solution could be built. At that point, I started looking for people to help me bring the idea to life.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the format, we decided to create a website. We thought about creating an app, but it would be harder to develop, restricted to mobile devices, and harder to convince people to use it. We thought about creating a Newsletter, but... isn't this exactly the problem we're trying to solve?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We even thought about a simple shared google spreadsheet just to validate the idea, but we've found one during research, so that ship was sailed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the content, we decided to start with quarantine related only. But shortly we started to share everything that was <b>free and possible to be done at home</b>. This decision was made so we have more diversity of content - and so the project wouldn't necessarily die off once the quarantine was over.

                                                <li><p><b>Tagline explaining the website</b></p>
                                                    <p>We added the tagline to the website's header: "The portal with everything so you can learn without leaving home".</p></li>
                                                <li><p><b>UX writing improvements</b></p>
                                                    <p>Button: Contribute → Submit a suggestion (only then we started getting suggestions through the form).</p> </li>
                                                <li><p><b>Home Screen</b></p>
                                                    <p>We added a home screen explaining each category available, the ammount of entries each one had and how many entries were added/expiring that day.</p> </li>
                                                <li><p><b>Favorites</b></p>
                                                    <p>As the list of contents grew bigger, we added the possibility for users to save entries as favorites. That would allow users to filter entries they wanted to check out later.</p></li>
                                                <li><p><b>Personalized Lists</b></p>
                                                    <p>We then saw the opportunity of creating a feature that would: 1. Allow people to curate the content website according to their own needs, creating multiple personalised lists; 2. Encourage people to share their lists (and, thus, sharing our website).</p></li>
                                                <li><p><b>Courses only</b></p>
                                                    <p>After many months of pandemics and quarantine, the corporate production of free content and courses didn't keep up. In addition, people became saturated with lives and other online events.
                                                        <p>Thus, we opted to pivot the purpose of the site, reorganizing the categories focusing mainly on <b>free</b> courses and educational content.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>The new categories created were: <b>Courses with Certificate; Courses without Certificate; Events</b> (For congresses, conferences and other limited-time actions) <b>Content</b> (youtube, instagram or tik tok profiles, but always focusing on educational content).</p></li>
