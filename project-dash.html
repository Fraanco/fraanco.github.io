                    <p>The way this project came to being was very interesting though, and it's what makes me love it even more. Liber's CEO asked me to work on another feature, which would ask investors to define specifications of the investments they were interested on (based on price, profitability, risk, time, and etc). The idea was to make it easier for our operations team to offer the users the available investments.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first step for this project was to talk to the operations team, and figure out how they usually got those informations from users. My findings on this stage were much richer, though. Talking to one of our main team members I found out <span class="highlight">why the CEO wanted this feature</span>, and could dig deeper to find <span class="highlight">what was the real problem we needed to solve</span>: 
                    </p>

                                <li><b>The operation team was overwhelmed with calls from users.
                                </b><br>
                                <p>Some of the calls were related to new investments (problem which would probably be addressed by the original project), but most of them were from users asking for reports about their investments.</p></li>
                                <li><b>The users needed to call and ask for the reports because they couldn't find the information on our application. </b> <br>
                                    <p>They needed to call our team even if they wanted to know how much money they had with us, for example.</p></li>

                    <p>Thus, the real problem we needed to solve was the <span class="highlight">lack of information</span> available to the users, and a good way to measure the success of the project was the <span class="highlight">decrease in the number of calls</span> to the CX teams.</p>

                    <p>The first step was to <span class=highlight>⠀interview the team⠀</span>. That helped me to better understand the investor's persona, and the main questions they had; how was the operations contact with the users (what did they do for them, how did they explain the service and the product).
                    </p>
                    <p>For this stage I tried to talk to a multidisciplinary group, to get as many information as possible about how we dealt (and how they thing we should deal) with our users. I talked to 7 team members in total: the CEO and the CTO - to understand the business and product vision for that feature; two members of the Costumer Success team - to understand their daily life, and their feelings about the user's experience ; 2 members of the finance team - to reach a better understanding of investment jargons and other specificities of the field; and the company's lawyer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Although the questions would vary a little depending on the interviewee's field of work and specialty, the aim of the Team Interview was to
                        cover some basic topics:</p>

                    <p>This step of the process was very valuable, since it enlightened me about other products our users were using (benchmarking!) and their level of experience with our product's market and context (financial investments and supply chain financing).

                    <p>It is incredibly tempting for stakeholders to reach us with an idea of a solution (a new feature or an extra screen on the website, for example), but it is our duty as designers to <span class=highlight>⠀understand what the problem is⠀</span> before diving into wireframing and prototyping.

                    <p>
                        • More time to create specific designs for each form factor. The design for this feature was made with the web form factor in mind (since the most used devices to access our product were notebooks and desktops at the time). Some of the modules should have a better presentation in the mobile app, since the adaptation didn't work too well for it.t

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • I wish I had more time to test the modules before developing. In a future project, the combination of the modular designing and developing could count with some testing before starting the development.
